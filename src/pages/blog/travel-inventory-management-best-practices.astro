    "How many seats are left on the December 15th departure?" In many tour operations, 
    answering this simple question requires checking multiple spreadsheets, calling the 
    operations manager, and hoping the information is up to date.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Poor inventory management leads to overbookings, lost sales, and operational chaos. 
    Here's how to master travel inventory management and run your departures smoothly.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding Travel Inventory</h2>
  
  <p>
    Travel inventory is fundamentally different from retail inventory. You're not stocking 
    physical products—you're managing time-limited availability:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perishable:</strong> An empty seat on today's departure is lost forever</li>
    <li><strong>Variable:</strong> The same trip may have different capacity based on vehicle, accommodation, or guide availability</li>
    <li><strong>Interconnected:</strong> A hotel room, guide, vehicle, and activity slot must all be available simultaneously</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Availability changes constantly as bookings come in and cancellations occur</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Inventory Management Problems</h2>

  <h3>1. Overbooking</h3>
  <p>
    When sales and operations aren't synchronized, you end up with more confirmed bookings 
    than available capacity. This leads to uncomfortable customer conversations, refunds, 
    and reputation damage.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Underselling</h3>
  <p>
    Conversely, you might block inventory unnecessarily or fail to release holds when 
    customers don't confirm. Meanwhile, you turn away customers who wanted to book.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Visibility Gaps</h3>
  <p>
    When inventory data lives in spreadsheets that only one person updates, your sales 
    team is always working with outdated information.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Manual Updates</h3>
  <p>
    Every booking requires manual updates to availability. When you're busy, updates get 
    delayed, creating accuracy issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Best Practices for Travel Inventory Management</h2>

  <h3>1. Centralize Your Inventory System</h3>
  <p>
    All inventory data—departures, capacity, current bookings, holds—should live in a single 
    system that everyone can access. This eliminates the "let me check with operations" delay 
    and ensures everyone works with the same information.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Implement Real-Time Updates</h3>
  <p>
    When a booking is confirmed, inventory should update automatically. When a cancellation 
    occurs, that capacity should immediately become available. No manual intervention required.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Use Hold Management</h3>
  <p>
    When a customer is interested but hasn't paid, you need a way to temporarily reserve 
    their spot without permanently blocking inventory. Implement a hold system with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic hold expiration after a defined period</li>
    <li>Visibility into all current holds</li>
    <li>Easy conversion from hold to confirmed booking</li>
    <li>Alerts when holds are about to expire</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Set Up Availability Alerts</h3>
  <p>
    Configure alerts for key inventory thresholds:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low availability:</strong> When a departure drops below 20% capacity remaining</li>
    <li><strong>Sold out:</strong> Immediately know when departures are full</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Alert sales when spots open up on popular departures</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Manage Waitlists</h3>
  <p>
    When departures sell out, capture interested customers on a waitlist. When cancellations 
    occur, automatically notify waitlisted customers in order.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Track Component Availability</h3>
  <p>
    A departure's capacity isn't just about seats—it's about all the components working 
    together. Track:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accommodation capacity (hotel rooms, camps, homestays)</li>
    <li>Vehicle capacity (buses, jeeps, flights)</li>
    <li>Guide and staff availability</li>
    <li>Activity slot limits</li>
    <li>Equipment availability (for adventure tours)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Plan for Seasonality</h3>
  <p>
    Travel demand is highly seasonal. Your inventory management should help you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add departures during peak seasons</li>
    <li>Reduce capacity during slow periods</li>
    <li>Track year-over-year patterns</li>
    <li>Forecast demand for planning</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8. Handle Group Bookings Carefully</h3>
  <p>
    Group bookings require special inventory handling. A group inquiry for 15 seats 
    shouldn't immediately block those seats (the conversion rate is low), but you need 
    to track the potential impact on availability.
  </p>

  <h2>Departure Management Workflows</h2>

  <blockquote>
    "The difference between a smooth departure and a chaotic one often comes down to 
    how well inventory was managed in the weeks before travel."
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Pre-Departure Checklist</h3>
  <p>
    Build a standardized checklist that triggers based on time before departure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>30 days before:</strong> Final capacity check, decide to proceed or cancel</li>
    <li><strong>14 days before:</strong> Finalize supplier bookings based on actual numbers</li>
    <li><strong>7 days before:</strong> Generate rooming lists, vehicle manifests, activity rosters</li>
    <li><strong>3 days before:</strong> Final confirmation to all suppliers and customers</li>
    <li><strong>Day of:</strong> Emergency contact list, departure briefing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Minimum Viable Departures</h3>
  <p>
    Define minimum booking thresholds for each departure type. If bookings don't reach 
    this threshold by a cutoff date, you can cancel the departure, combine with another 
    date, or proceed with adjusted operations.
  </p>

  <h2>How Wayon Handles Inventory Management</h2>
  
  <p>
    Wayon's inventory module was built specifically for tour operators who need more than 
    a spreadsheet but less than an enterprise system:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time availability:</strong> See exactly what's available across all departures</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic updates:</strong> Bookings and cancellations instantly reflect in inventory</li>
    <li><strong>Hold management:</strong> Temporary holds with auto-expiration and conversion</li>
    <li><strong>Overbooking prevention:</strong> System blocks sales when capacity is reached</li>
    <li><strong>Waitlist automation:</strong> Capture and notify waitlisted customers</li>
    <li><strong>Component tracking:</strong> Manage all the pieces that make up a departure</li>
    <li><strong>Departure status:</strong> Track confirmed, tentative, and cancelled departures</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Measuring Inventory Performance</h2>
  
  <p>
    Track these metrics to evaluate your inventory management:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Occupancy rate:</strong> Average percentage of capacity filled per departure</li>
    <li><strong>Booking velocity:</strong> How quickly departures fill up</li>
    <li><strong>Overbooking incidents:</strong> Should be zero!</li>
    <li><strong>Hold conversion rate:</strong> Percentage of holds that become bookings</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation impact:</strong> Capacity lost to cancellations vs. resold</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Effective inventory management is the foundation of profitable tour operations. 
    With the right systems and practices, you'll maximize revenue, minimize problems, 
    and deliver consistent customer experiences.
